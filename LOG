10/25/88:
lcc is an ANSI C compiler available to friendly users on coma.

Bit fields are parsed but ignored.  Trigraph sequences and the extended
character set are not supported.  The code for register variables needs
improvement.  The only cases now known to yield incorrect code involve
C++ output and programs that run out of registers, but there must be
more.  -g seems to work with pi, but it's very green.

ANSI-style header files are in /usr/include/lcc, which lcc searches.
A few prototypes may differ from what is actually in libc.a; the
consequence is usually a type error.  A header file for some V9
functions is on the way; more later on this.

For a man page, run "man lcc" or "troff -man /usr/cwf/book/man/lcc.1.v9".
Mail bug reports to both cwf and princeton!drh (Dave Hanson).
Please include a short program that exposes the bug.  Thanks.

11/8/88:
fixes several bugs with error handling, float and string constants,
register structs, and programs that exhaust register variables.
makes code for char and short int functions compatible with cc's code.

11/17/88:
fixes bugs in spills, in the declaration of longjump in lcc's
<setjmp.h>, and in the type system ("char" had compared equal to
"signed char", which ansi forbids).  improves error recovery.  plus
internal changes that are theoretically invisible.

it also puts some formals and locals in registers; "man lcc" elaborates.
the increased demand for registers may expose compiler bugs that have
been in hiding.  if you have regression tests, try them.

12/8/88:
fixes sizeof("x"), overzealous reuse of common subexprs, and a loop in
the spill emitter.  improves error reporting and code for many ++/--
ops (but prefix versions on registers still need work).  folds the
difference of two constant pointers.  defines standard "offsetof"
macro.

12/13/88:
fixes compiler crashes on certain spills in nested conditional exprs.
fixes bugs in hex char constants, in exprs with chains of unsigned
mods and divisions, and in *x=*x when x is volatile.  uses gcc's
preprocessor to offer more ANSI extensions.  adds bit fields, tho
they're pretty green, the layout's unique (see the man page), and the
code needs optimization.

12/19/88:
changes some diagnostics.  handles arbitrarily long lines.  emits
slightly better code for switches and functions that return structs.
fixes an infinite loop when undeclared identifiers appeared in
initializers, an incorrectly formatted error message for illegal
characters, and bad code for x:goto x and for *f()=g() when g returns
a struct.  ignores -O, because /lib/c2 can trash lcc's code.  adds -n,
which compiles code to detect certain zero-pointer errors; the man
page elaborates.

1/5/89:
improves diagnostics.  deletes warnings about unused return values,
except when they're structures.  fixes minor errors in the standard
include files.  stops losing the token following asm("...").  emits
slightly worse code for nested calls, in preparation for a mips
target.  several internal changes that should have no effect.

1/9/89:
improves entry code for some functions.  gets clr/inc instructions even
if the 0/1 is expressed oddly (eg, 0x1).  corrects bad code for
(unsigned)c==0xff, for f(g().b) when b's offset >0, and for -u>0 for
unsigned u.  returns to the old code for nested calls, so f(x?h():0),
f(x&&h()), and f(x||h()) work again.  corrects minor flaws in string.h.

2/1/89:

improves diagnostics.  improves handling of long parameter lists, long
string constants, and integral constants between 2^31-1 and 2^32-1.
responds to constant overflow in a machine-independent fashion.
flattens nested calls (for the mips target).  corrects bad code for
a[2*i]=f(a[2*i]), (double)(float)0.3, stab entries for initialized
statics, and some nested conditionals.  assigns registers differently:
r0-5 are now for temporaries, and r6-11 for variables.  fixes several
crashes and assertion failures:  if you've had some, try them now;
otherwise ignore.

2/10/89:

-A now warns about calls to functions without prototypes.  diagnostics
now include only the line number and omit the character position.
empty declarations in parameter lists (eg, "f() struct s {int x;};")
are now errors, and other empty declarations (eg, "int;") now draw
warnings.  no longer forbids const struct members (eg, "struct {const
int a,b;}").  several internal but theoretically invisible changes.

2/11/89:

fixes an endless compiler loop and a bug in bit field initialization
that showed up only on the mips.

2/14/89:

improves constant folding (eg, 0&&x, -1&x).  fixes bugs:  applying
sizeof to explicit array types sometimes made lcc loop or crash; some
dissimilar floating point constants (eg, -111111.0 and
-111111.00000000002) were treated as equivalent during constant
folding; some conditional exprs involving constants gave a compiler
error (eg, i = 5.6 && i ? 1 : 2;) or bad code (eg, *p = (int *)0 &&
*(int *)0 ? 4 : 5;).  fixes a bug in the code that spills a temporary
register when they're all gone; numerical programs were the most likely
to have been effected.

2/17/89:

fixes an assertion failure in the code that spills a register.

2/24/89:

/usr/include/nlcc shipped.  it's a directory of mostly new .h files for
lcc.  in 10 days or so, these files will replace those now in
/usr/include/lcc, which lcc searches before /usr/include.

fio.h, libc.h, and u.h are non-ansi local contributions from various
sources.  the rest are intended to match the standard, which can be
irritating but is necessary for portability.  the standard errno.h is
omitted because the local one suits ansi.

users interested more in convenience than in portability are welcome
to edit fio.h, libc.h, and u.h and to add new .h files; do so on
bowell or your changes will get lost.  don't edit the other headers --
they're maintained mechanically from another source.  if you find a bug
in one of these, post cwf and princeton!drh.  for portability, we want
to keep non-standard stuff out of these files, but we do want to hear
about bugs.

these are just headers.  lcc will continue to use cc's libraries
indefinitely.

3/1/89:

in the absence of -g, removes immediate tail recursion from
non-variadic functions.  old-style, variadic, tail-recursive functions
are optimized incorrectly, so give a prototype.

-s now controls which switches become branch tables; the man page
elaborates.  also, the man page now warns of bad code for switches over
32kb; repairs soon.

fixes bug that put formals in scope too early, which caused bad code
or core dumps for some programs like "int a;f(a)int a[sizeof a];{}".
no longer treats 1/0 and similar expressions as constant expressions.
corrects diagnostics and compiler crashes for certain erroneous
inputs.

adds gauss to distribution list.

3/10/89:

implements 2c's structure extensions, except for in-line structure
exprs.  replaces -s with -d to avoid conflict with ld's -s.  adds -v,
which prints commands as they are executed; see the man page.  uses the
two-operand instructions like addl2 a little more often.  places
initialized const data in a readonly segment.  bags casel
instructions, so switches over 32kb now work.  no longer omits
unreferenced, anonymous types from -g symbol tables.  improves
diagnostics.

corrects a few bugs in /usr/include/nlcc, which replaces
/usr/include/lcc on 3/14.  speak now or forever hold your peace.

3/11/89:

corrects bad code for switches and for "y>(float)0.0?y:-(double)y".
avoids an ld bug with external initialized consts.
deletes -B's "using" message.

3/16/89:

/usr/include/lcc shipped, a couple of days later than promised.  it's
exactly what's been soaking in /usr/include/nlcc, in which fio.h,
libc.h, and u.h were the latest local contributions (at least on
coma), and the rest were conformed with the standard, except that the
standard errno.h was omitted because the local one suits ansi.

the old headers are in /usr/include/olcc, so try -I/usr/include/olcc
if you get in a jam.  /usr/include/nlcc unshipped.

users interested more in convenience than in portability are welcome
to edit fio.h, libc.h, and u.h and to add new .h files; do so on
bowell or your changes will get lost.  don't edit the other headers --
they're maintained mechanically from another source.

these are just headers.  lcc continues to use cc's libraries.

3/23/89:

fixes a register fragmentation bug by eschewing odd double registers;
if you use a lot of doubles, retry any regression tests that you might
have.  fixes bugs in a few diagnostics.  assert.h may now be included
more than once without calamity.  -P prints function prototypes for all
defined functions and globals in a form suitable for use in header
files; see the man page.  plus several internal changes that should
have no effect.

3/29/89:

fixes several spill bugs; code with large double exprs is most
likely to have been bogus.  accepts wide-character literals and treats
them like ordinary character literals.  treats `long int' and `long
double' as types distinct from int and double, but with the same sizes
and alignments; they had been treated as identical types, which is
wrong.  deletes bogus diagnostics for:

	int *const p = (int *const)0;
	int *x = (f(), 0);
	typedef int I;main(){I I(I);}

3/29/89:

fixes two bugs new in this morning's (3/29) lcc:

calls to char and short functions gave a fatal compiler error.

type `unsigned long int' was missing; variables so declared were taken
to be `long int', so, for example, right shift of an unsigned long
erroneously extended the sign bit.  the repair causes non-trivial
expressions involving long int, long unsigned, and long double to have
types int, unsigned, and double, respectively.  this behavior should
not affect the generated code because ints *are* long ints, etc., but
it might mask type errors.

4/16/89:

bug fixed:  casts to enum types weren't treated as ints.

new feature:  in asm("string") occurrences of `%name' are replaced by
the address or register for the identifier `name' if `name' is
visible.  the man page elaborates.

/usr/include/lcc now holds only the headers specified by the ANSI
standard.  The local headers (fio.h, libc.h, u.h) and a local version
of stdio.h are now in /usr/include/libc.  lcc now searches the latter
before the former, so the default will find the local stdio.h.  -N
tells lcc to discard its usual search list and use only directories
named in explicit -I args.  So use "lcc -N -I/usr/include/lcc" to
ensure conformance with the ANSI standard.  Report bugs in the standard
headers to cwf.  Report bugs in the local headers to rob.  Don't edit
either set directly -- they're maintained mechanically from central
sources, so edits will get lost.

4/19/89:

some function definitions inconsistent their prototypes went
undetected (eg, extern int f(int); void f(x)int x;{}).

long ints were erroneously promoted to ints.  this bug showed up in
prototype errors (eg, extern f(long); f(n) long n; {}).

implements 2c's in-line struct exprs ((struct foo) {...}).  the code's
poor, and run-time alignment errors can occur for incomplete exprs.
improvements soon.

structs have always been aligned to suit their strictest member.  to
fix some alignment crashes on the mips, they are now additionally
guaranteed int alignment (four bytes on all current targets).  so
recompile all modules that use structures composed entirely of chars
and shorts.  yacc and lex produce some.

4/28/89:

"-(unsigned long)x" crashed the compiler.  bit fields and functions
were erroneously permitted as arguments to sizeof.  pointers to enums
were not treated as pointers to ints, which drew erroneous type errors
(eg, in "enum {...} *ap; int *x = ap;").

local arrays are now guaranteed int alignment.  the old, weaker
alignment sometimes made array initialization code crash on the mips.

"#pragma ref id" now simulates a reference to id; it may be used to
suppress a warning about an otherwise unreferenced variable (eg, a
sccs id).

-N now turns off the non-ansi local extensions in addition to restricting
the search for header files to only those directories named by -I.

5/1/89:

fixes bug in some subscript computations for multi-dimensioned char
arrays of length 4 or less.  this bug occurred only in the presence of
char arrays in which each element was initialized or initialized
structs with bit fields.

5/11/89:

improves code for arithmetic and boolean ops on chars and shorts.  if
you use these a lot, run any regression tests that you have.

the algorithm used to induce register variables has been changed.
registers are assigned to locals and parameters if their weighted
reference count is at least 3.  each reference counts adds X, where X
starts out at 1 and is multiplied by 10 in each loop, by 1/2 in each
then/else, and by 1/10 in each switch.

4/28's fix that made `pointer to enum' equivalent to `pointer to int'
was too permissive.  warnings are now issued for assignments between
`pointer to int' and `pointer to enum'.  all other combinations are
errors.

structs are no longer guaranteed int alignment.  they are still aligned
to suit their strictest member.  recompile modules that use structures
composed entirely of chars and shorts.  yacc and lex produce some.

tail recursion is no longer removed.  errors occurred when locals were
aliased.

some valid combinations of qualified pointers in result arms of ?:
caused erroneous diagnostics, and incorrect uses of types pointer and
int in result arms of ?: went undetected.

some subscript computations for multi-dimensioned char arrays of
length 4 or less were incorrect because their types were mangled.
this bug occurred only in the presence of char arrays in which each
element was initialized or initialized structs with bit fields.

casts from integer types to long double were silently ignored.  real
constants suffixed by "l" or "L" were erroneously type double; they're
now type long double.

UINT_MAX was missing from <limits.h>.  time_t, wchar_t, size_t and
clock_t are now protected from redefinition.  the compiler erroneously
accepted and silently ignored preprocessor statements; except for
#pragma, they now draw an error.

5/19/89:

f(){int (*a)[];(*a)[5] = 0;} is now accepted.

variables referenced mainly in deeply nested control structure were
erroneously reported as unreferenced.

no more arbitrary limit on the number of scope levels.

5/27/89:

Type casts were erroneously accepted as l-values.  On the vax, bad code
was silently generated for signed div and mod ops when the destination
was a (signed or unsigned) char or short.

6/2/89:

now accepts "int a = 3;extern int a;".  some constant expressions with
casts were not accepted as constants (eg, ~((unsigned short) 0)).
fixes bad code for struct args whose size is not divisible by four.

6/8/89:

improves diagnostics.  some valid field references in extended
structures were erroneously flagged as errors.  e&0 always returned 0
and never evaluated e, even if e had side effects.  ignores
unrecognized preprocessor control lines.

8/3/89:

fixes compiler crashes caused by long string constants with lots of
escaped characters.

the va_start macro in stdarg.h did not handle char or short arguments
correctly.

on the vax, bad code was generated for some assignments to unsigned
char (eg, "char a[10]; unsigned char b = a[i];").

signed divisions by a constant power of two are no longer performed by
shifts; the results were inconsistent with the standard, which
requires that (a/b)*b + a%b == a.

some illegal casts in constant expressions were erroneously accepted
(eg, "int x, y=(int)&x;").

missing tags were erroneously permitted in some struct declarations
(eg, "struct *p;").

now allows a terminal comma in enums, unless -N (strict ANSI) is
specified.

warns about switch statements with no cases and about functions
declared static but never defined or referenced.

with -A, warnings about missing prototypes are now issued only once
instead of once per call.

doug has merged the man pages for cc and lcc.

8/8/89:

fixes bad code for x=y<<1 when x is a short.

8/29/89:

preprocessor generated lines of the form `# n "name"' and `# n' are
accepted.

repeated initializations of an array type defined by a typedef
(typedef char str[]; str a = "hi", b = "there";) elicited incorrect
error messages.

on the mips, some initialized structures that began with a char or
short were misaligned.

shamash and bartok added to the shipping list.

9/16/89:

better code for comparing bit fields with 0 and for setting them to all
1s or 0s; manipulating 1-bit fields is as efficient as using flags with
explicit | and & operators.

eliminates more dead code.

eliminates multiple copies of some constants.

fixes bad code for multiple assignment to bit fields in the same word
(eg, struct { unsigned x:1,y:1; } *p; p->x = p->y = 1;).

fixes bad code for some logical operators with constant operands (eg,
x||1).

fixes a compiler crash on the mips for some calls that pass a float and
return a struct.

9/29/89:

takes care to emit only non-empty .s files on the mips, whose assembler
cares.  corrects bad mips code in some cases when one of the first four
formals gets assigned to a register and is declared (old-style) to be a
(single-precision) float.

10/4/89:

in unions with bit fields, the offsets for subsequent fields were
wrong.  unions comprised entirely of bit fields were thought to be of
size 0, which drew a bad diagnostic.  math.h's HUGE_VAL is now less
conservative.  several numbers in limits.h were wrong.

10/21/89:

hex escapes now properly include the longest possible run of hex digits
after the \x, even when the value is too big for a char.  lcc truncates
and warns about octal and hex escapes with values that won't fit in 8
bits.  it also warns about undefined escapes like \c.

local declarations of static functions that were previously defined
drew erroneous mismatched declaration warnings.

better code for e1?e2:0.

fixes bad struct returns for functions that explicitly declare more
register locals than lcc allows for the target.

different code for spills.

on the 68020, fixes bad code for "return i%j".

limits.m4 now casts INT_MIN to int and LONG_MIN to long.  without the
casts, the 0x80000000 ended up unsigned.

10/24/89:

for new-style functions, float actuals corresponding to int or long
formals went unconverted.  eg, "f(int x) { float y; f(y); }" failed to
convert y.

error messages for the redeclaration of enum ids misreported the
location of the previous declaration.

on the vax, <unsigned constant> >> <anything> generated bad code.

on the vax, casts that narrowed and then widened an indexing expr
generated bad code.

limits.h substitutes exprs for some hard constants to reduce machine
dependencies.

11/3/89:

a missing } at the end of file drew a garbled diagnostic.

lcc crashed when a conditional expr fed a binary op that fed a
bit field assignment.

lcc crashed when the value of x?y:0 was not used.

new driver for lcc.  no -M.  preprocessor and compiler are now
connected with a pipe.  flags must now precede file names and
libraries.

11/7/89:

on the vax, fixed bad code for *s&&*s++.

11/17/89:

casts of constants to illegal types caused an assertion failure.  no
longer warns about switches with only the default case.  now allows
more generated labels.  the new driver hung on long programs with too
many errors.

on v9 vaxes, now supplies -J to the assembler.

on tempel, RAND_MAX was too small.  on all mips machines, lcc exited
with status 0 even with errors.  an omission from the mipsco docs led
to an incompatibility with code from cc for new-style functions with
single-precision floats as arguments 2, 3, or 4.

12/26/89:

constants burn less time and space.  large initializations compile much
faster.

vertical tabs and form feeds were previously treated as newlines;
they're now treated as blanks.

~~x and -(-x) have been replaced with just x.

specifying both -A and -n drew inappropriate missing prototype
messages.

types defined in parameter lists were inaccessible within the
function.

the compiler crashed when the value of "x,y" was used and y was a
relational or conditional expr.

the compiler crashed when a void (eg, via a cast) was assigned to a bit
field.

on the mips, an invalid instruction was generated for a register float
used as argument 2, 3, or 4.  the assembler rejected it.

on the mips, literals have been moved to the text segment.

on the mips, -p now works.  as with cc on (only) these machines, it
does not count calls.  for that, use "pixie", which works with lcc's
a.outs.

on the 68020, -g generated incomplete symbol table information for
structures that were used before being defined
(eg "struct A; g(struct A *x) {} struct A { int a,b; };")

CLOCKS_PER_SECOND is now 1000000 everywhere.  that's now consistent
with the clock function on the mips and 68020 machines, and it's
irrelevant on the vaxes, because their libraries don't include the
function.

numerous internal improvements, all theoretically invisible.

2/2/90:

sizeof erroneously returned an int.  it now returns an unsigned as
dictated by ANSI.  WARNING: the pre-ANSI sizeof returned an int, so lcc
has been masking a potential problem with the conversion of pre-ANSI
programs.

casts in integer constant exprs in array bounds, enum defs, and field
widths sometimes gave bad values.

string constant arguments of asm directives were handled wrong, which
made the compiler crash or emit bad diagnostics.

comparisons of ints and pointers like i==(int*)1 crashed the compiler.

arrays with unspecified bounds are now noted as an `incomplete array'
in error messages.

reuses of common subexprs in conditional exprs sometimes generated bad
code.

on the vax, bad code was generated for unsigned right shift by a
non-constant when r0 was busy.

on the suns, the register save mask at function entry and exit for
floating point registers was incorrect.

lcc -E foo.i (foo.s) erroneously compiled (assembled) the given file.

several theoretically transparent internal changes.

2/20/90:

lcc no longer crashes when presented with local arrays of undefined
structs or with calls to functions that return const structs.

u%2^n now generates the same code as u&(2^n-1) for unsigned u and
constant 2^n.

on the suns, RAND_MAX is now 2^31-1, which contradicts the man page but
is consistent with what rand() seems to do.

2/21/90:

fixes bad code introduced yesterday on all targets for u%2^n for
unsigned u and constant 2^n.

2/28/90:

multiple assignments to bit fields in the first word of a struct (like
struct {unsigned a:1,b:1;} x; x.a=x.b=1;) no longer generate bad code.

extra parentheses in declarations (like int *(x(int));) sometimes crashed
the compiler.

the driver sometimes erroneously removed input .o files.

-Wp<arg> now passes <arg> to the preprocessor.  -Wa, -Wl, and -Wf do
likewise for the assembler, linker, and compiler proper.  <arg> is
passed untouched; if the recipient expects a leading dash, give it
explicitly.

-T is gone.  use -Wp-T instead.

3/2/90:

fixed incorrect optimization of i%1 on all machines.

on the vax, -Wf-k now avoids some of the instructions that may fail
when used to access i/o space.  it does not protect against all
dangers:  don't touch i/o space via the program counter, floating point
instructions, struct copies (including struct args and return values),
or calls (eg, don't index a table of function pointers with an i/o
cell).  i can't thoroughly test this option myself, so beware.

3/8/90:

relaxes an overzealous assert() in the register spiller.

many internal cleanups, all theoretically invisible outside.

3/17/90:

the compiler was crashing on x+=(const int)1

on the mips, fixes bad code for functions that take a double or float
as arg#1 and return a struct.

on the vax, slightly different tradeoffs between movl $_x and moval _x.

3/26/90:

better assignment of variables to registers.  explicit register dcls
are still obeyed first, but any remaining regs are now assigned to
variables in order of estimated payoff.

bad floating constants like 1e and 1e+ were erroneously accepted.

diagnostics for illegal break and continue statements were garbled.

inline struct expressions now accept struct-valued fields, eg
struct Point { int x, y; } p, q;
struct Rectangle { struct Point min, max;} r = (struct Rectangle){p, q};

on v9 vaxes, lcc now emits some symbol table data even without -g.  the
intent is to mimic cc, though lcc documents globals as well as locals
and formals.

compiler flags are no longer required to precede filenames.  like cc,
they may appear anywhere but are processed before any files.

lcc, like cc, now removes a .o file iff exactly one source file (.c,
.s, .i) appears and no other file (source, object, library) or -l
option appears.

5/9/90:

warnings are no longer issued for calls to struct functions in which
the returned struct is not used.

lines containing only white space and one # are now ignored.

-N now suppresses recognition of asm("...").

ansi multibyte characters like 'abc' are now accepted, and lcc warns
about ignoring the excess characters.

-P now prints char* even if a typedef for char* has been defined.

sizeof(L'x') is now correctly the same as sizeof(wchar_t), which is 1.
sizeof('x') is still the same as sizeof(int), as it must be.

for constant y, 0&&y (0||y) erroneously returned y instead of y!=0.

initializing char a[N] with a string of exactly N chars caused the
trailing null byte to be omitted from other N-char strings appearing
before the offending initialization.

the value of bit field assignments was erroneously taken to be the
right operand instead of the value of the left operand.  eg, for
an unsigned 3-bit field x, f(b.x=15) passed 15.  it now passes 7.

casts and structs returned by functions were erroneously permitted as
l-values.

exprs like &(((struct foo)0)->x[0]) and array-sizeof(array) were not
recognized as constant.  they were thus erroneously forbidden in
initializers.

casts in the operands of ?: sometimes caused an assertion failure.

using the value from a postincrement or postdecrement of a bit field
caused an assertion failure.

legal comparisons of qualified and unqualified compatible pointers were
erroneously diagnosed as type errors.

for function f, &f was erroneously diagnosed as an error.

types `function returning T' and `array of T' were not uniformly converted
to `pointer to function returning T' and `pointer to T', respectively.

char *a; void *b; a?b:c was erroneously diagnosed as a type error.

initialization of automatic structs with const fields was erroneously
diagnosed as an assignment error.

types other than int, signed int, or unsigned int were erroneously
permitted for bit fields and const and volatile qualifiers were
erroneously forbidden.

repeated block-level declarations for functions were erroneously
diagnosed as redeclaration errors.

valid assignment of pointers to qualified or unqualified versions of
compatible types was erroneously diagnosed as a type error, e.g.,
const char *a;const char *volatile *b=&a;

on the 68020, lcc gave bad code for x=f(x) where f returns a struct.

on the 68020, lcc erroneously converted floats and doubles to ints by
rounding.  it now correctly truncates any fraction.

on the 68020 and mips, lcc gave bad code for calls in which the
function was computed with another call, like (*g(f(1)))(2).

on the mips, -p caused prof to report incorrect file names.

on the mips, fixes bad code for f(x<op>y) when x is a floating point
register and <op> is an augmented assignment.

on the vax, fixes bad code for signed comparisons of chars with
constants not in [-0x80..0x7f] and of shorts with constants not in
[-0x8000..0x7fff].  lcc treats plain chars as signed chars, so they
were afflicted too.

on the vax, fixes bad code for u>0 and u<=0, for any unsigned expr u.

the dummy parameter names were removed from the ansi include files.
eg, f(int x) is now f(int) instead.  

limits.h was rewritten to use simpler exprs and to avoid casts.
#if misevaluated some of the old exprs, and it doesn't do casts.

don't use the unsigned constant suffix (eg, 0u) in #if commands.
the preprocessor can't cope.

numerous theoretically invisible internal improvements.

5/9/90:

The lcc compiler now passes the conformance section of Version 1.09 of
the Plum Hall Validation Suite for ANSI C, subject to the restrictions
below.

We do not have a conforming preprocessor or library.

The lcc command must use -N and enable trigraphs with -Wp-T.  It must
use -I to search only the ANSI standard headers.  It may need to
undefine some of the system-specific pre-defined symbols;  -v exposes
these.

The only versions of lcc tested to date are the ones running on the SGI
4D/240S under IRIX System V Release 3.2.1, on the VAX 8550 under
UNIX V10, and on the Sun-3 under SunOS Release 4.0.

5/11/90:

for float constant x, -x was not recognized as constant.

for volatile x, x++ drew unwarranted warnings.

7/6/90:

stores enums in unsigned/signed chars, unsigned/signed shorts, or ints
depending on the range of the enum constants.  this change may alter
struct layouts and the size of globals, so discard old object files
that use enums.  it also causes diagnostics when new-style declarations
are mixed with old-style definitions for functions with enum arguments,
so enum foo {a,b,c}; int f(enum foo); ... f(x) enum foo x; {...}
is equivalent to int f(char); ... f(x) char x; {...}
which is an error because the prototype in the declaration doesn't
match the prototype inferred from the definition (which is int f(int)).

permits up to 127 formals.

limits identifiers and numeric constants to 64 characters;
string constants can have up to 4096 characters.

better diagnostics; some warnings are now errors.

eliminates more branch chains.

on the mips, lcc now truncates constant shift counts to 5 bits.  the
assembler did this before, but it squawked first.

-t produces code to print trace messages at function entry & exit.

the driver now ignores duplicate `.o' files, eg, `lcc x.c x.o' is
identical to `lcc x.c'.

provides errno.h, which simply includes /usr/include/errno.h.

numerous internal improvements, all theoretically invisible.

errors fixed:

erroneously permitted 0x as a hexadecimal constant.

failed to treat (double)<unsigned constant> as constant.

did not detect overflow in enumeration constants, eg, for B in
enum {A=INT_MAX, B}.  it still fails to detect underflow/overflow in
constant expressions, which it really ought to do.

erroneously permitted declarations and definitions for functions
returning unknown structures.

erroneously permitted application of unary + to any scalar type.

erroneously permitted comma expressions in constant expressions.

erroneously permitted negative bit field widths.

did not recognize simple function types in casts, eg, int().

incorrectly used the type of x or y for c?x:y where c is a constant;
the correct type is the composite type of x and y; eg, the type of
1?(char*)p:(const char*q) is const char* not char* .

`lcc -g foo.i' emitted incorrect line number information if foo.i
didn't include `# n file' directives.

-g did not emit line number information for initialized locals.

7/9/90:

on the vax, lcc generated code that wouldn't even assemble for
char c;unsigned short *v;f(){c = v[c];}

8/27/90:

-b produces code that writes an expression-level profile into
prof.out.  bprint turns the data into an annotated listing, and lcc
-Wf-a uses it to improve register assignments.  the man pages for lcc
and bprint elaborate.

warns about implicit returns for functions that return other than int
or void; -A includes int functions.

-E now preprocesses unsuffixed file arguments.

sign extends integer right shift in constant expressions on all targets.

many internal improvements, all theoretically invisible.

errors fixed:

-t caused an erroneous redeclaration message for printf.

failed to convert x from double to float in f(x) const/volatile float x; {...}

erroneously forbid const/volatile enum {...} x in switch (x) and in int y=x.

erroneously forbid enum bit fields for enum types that are compatible
with int, signed int, or unsigned.

variadic functions with structure arguments did not work; 1 and 2-byte
structs still fail on big endians (non-DEC MIPS, Motorola, SPARC), and
8-byte structs and those holding doubles fail on all MIPSes.

with -g on V10 VAXes, bad symbol table names for anonymous structs,
unions, and enums.

with -g on the Sun (68020 & SPARC), bad symbol table entries for
mutually referential structs.

with -g, misplaced or omitted symbol table entries for statics,
externs, typedefs, and types defined in nested blocks.

assertion failure on illegal casts of constants, eg, (struct foo)0.

assertion failure on switch(x.y) {...} where y is an undefined field.

8/28/90:

on the vax, an unsigned div/mod common subexpr that was also an
argument caused lcc to loop.  on the sparc, it happened for all
int/unsigned div/mod/mul operations.

9/5/90:

now permits any number of parameters.

volatile locals and parameters are no longer assigned to registers.

with -g, parameters are no longer assigned to registers; some debuggers
couldn't cope.

generated bad symbolic addresses in constant expressions involving
externals declared inside blocks.

misdiagnosed as errors some multiple assignments of returned structs,
eg, struct p {...} f(); struct r {struct p c;} x,y; x.c = y.c = f();

on sparcs, generated unaligned code after some initialized const data.

9/13/90:

erroneously elided calls to struct functions in conditional expressions
where the resulting value went unused, eg, i?y:f()

assertion failure on conditional expressions with calls to struct
functions, eg, x=i?y:f()

improved diagnostics.

theoretically invisible internal improvements.

9/14/90:

lcc crashed on f(){const struct { int a; } *fp;fp++;}

9/21/90:

dropped backslashes that appeared at positions evenly divided by 4096.

on v10 vaxes, now emits stab entries for locals even without -g,
for consistency with cc.

on sparcs, fixes bad code for some argument lists that perform
a mul/div/mod after the third argument.

10/22/90:

improvements/changes:
warns about static declarations that specify incomplete types.

diagnoses declarations that specify objects with sizes >= 2^31.

detects overflow in constant expressions and treats such expressions
as non-constant expressions; compiling old code may fail.

better register allocation for leaf functions.  on sparcs, better
register allocation for all functions.

elides unreferenced locals.

warns about bit-field initializers that are too big.

with -N, duplicate global definitions in separately compiled
files cause loader errors; compiling old code may fail.

improved diagnostics.

errors fixed:
erroneously permitted static function declarations in blocks.

erroneously diagnosed valid multiple declarations within blocks.

computed incorrect composite types from multiple declarations.

with -g, the Sun assembler choked on long symbol table entries;
continuations are now emitted.

with -t, assertion failure on `return f(x)' where f returns a struct.

bad values for (unsigned)d when 2147483647 < double d <= 4294967295.

erroneously forbid carriage returns in strings.

10/23/90:

fixes floating overflow in constant multiplications in which one
nonzero argument is between -1.0 and 1.0.

11/28/90:

Now accepts #line.  It has for a month, but I forgot to say so before.

Now ignores multiple occurrences of just `.o' file arguments.
Formerly, it ignored multiple occurrences of ALL file arguments.

With -A, now warns about declarations and casts with prototype-less
function types.  Formerly, it warned only at calls.

Warns about casts from pointers to integral types that are too small.

Overflow in constant exprs has been demoted from an error to a warning.

Conversions between pointers to objects and pointers to functions are
now properly diagnosed.

Void and struct operands to bitwise and, or and xor operators no longer
cause an assertion failure.

With -t, an illegal void return value or argument no longer causes an
assertion failure.

On MIPSes, functions with 3 or more float arguments no longer cause an
assertion failure.

On Suns and V10 Vaxes, now detects overflow in float and double
constants.  It is supposed to do so on all targets, but some of them
have sub-standard strtod's.

On Suns, lcc now accepts the ld options -Bstatic and -Bdynamic.

On SPARCs, fixes bad code when passing structures followed by
floats/doubles.

On SPARCs, -p and -pg now work.

On V10 VAXes, formals may now get assigned to registers.  An error
introduced several months ago had been forcing them into the stack.

12/6/90:

The compiler crashed after diagnosing some syntax errors involving
top-level functions (eg, "void *a();static b(int)c(){}").

With -b, the execution count for e2 in "for(e1;e2;e3)S" was wrong for
loops not guaranteed to execute at least once.

On the MIPS, the compiler crashed when frequently referenced locals
were used in deeply nested loops.  The reference count estimate
overflowed.

On the SPARC, fixes (again!) bad code when passing structures followed
by floats/doubles.

On the SPARC, adds missing prototype to infinity() in math.h.

12/13/90:

Since 10/26/90, -N has arranged loader diagnostics for duplicate global
definitions in separately compiled modules.  The arrangement, however,
placed uninitialized globals in the data segment, which made some .o
files huge.  Such globals have now been shifted back to the bss
segment, saving space without losing the loader diagnostics.  On the
MIPS, discard old .o files created with -N;  they might be compatable
with new ones, but only an ld expert could guarantee it.

[Without -N, uninitialized globals are emitted as "common" blocks, so
loaders -- contrary to ANSI -- may silently merge duplicate
definitions.  -N is overloaded: it also forbids extensions and searches
for includes in only directories given by -I options.]

lcc crashed when unknown enum types were used in contexts that required
their sizes.

lcc crashed or died with an assertion failure when parameter names were
missing from new-style function definitions (eg, f(int){}).

bprint crashed when prof.out had data for functions with >200 execution
point counters.

12/21/90:

lcc issued an erroneous ``lvalue required'' diagnostic for x[0]=f()
when f returns a struct.

1/24/91:

now reports as errors identifiers longer than 64 characters when they
may cause parsing errors (because they span input buffers).

erroneously forbid initialized local const arrays:
f(){const char msg[]="hi";}

erroneously warned about missing return values for:
const void f(){}
volatile void f(){}

erroneously permitted function definitions with invalid uses of void
arguments, some of which caused the compiler to crash:
f(void,...){}
g(void, int){}
h(void, void){}

aborted with an assertion failure on casts of a return value to void:
void f(){return(void)23;}

crashed when printing warnings about unreferenced const volatile statics.

[I can't reach the Sun-3's or quetzal now.  I'll update these machines
later.]

2/14/91:

Misidentified characters with ASCII codes greater than 127.

switch(x) where x is a struct or union caused an assertion failure.

On the vax, silently generated bad code for
*<expr with ++ or --> = <expr with unsigned div/mod>
(This was fixed last time, but I forgot to announce it.)

On the vax, does a better job of using two-operand instructions (eg,
addl2) and deleting gratuitous tst instructions.

The warnings have been regularized somewhat.  Use "-A -A" to flag
missing prototypes and as many undefined behaviors as possible; use
"-A" to flag little more than missing prototypes; use no -A options for
relative quiet.

with -A, warns about:
   missing prototypes in function types
   missing return value in a return from an int function
  *assignments between pointers to ints and pointers to enumerations
  *conversions from pointers to smaller integral types

a second -A also warns about:
   non-ANSI language extensions
   non-ANSI source characters in character and string literals
  *unrecognized control lines
  *unreferenced variables and static functions
  *more than 32kb in an array, struct, or union
   more than 509 characters in a string literal
   more than 127 case labels in a switch statement
   more than 31 formal parameters
   more than 15 levels of nested statements
   more than 127 identifiers declared in a block
   more than 511 external identifiers
   more than 127 fields in a struct or union
   more than 127 enumeration constants in an enumeration

* marks those warnings that were given *without* -A previously.

Formerly, -N cleared the #include search list, disabled language
extensions, and arranged for duplicate global definitions in separately
compiled files to cause loader errors.  It now fools only with
#includes;  -A -A handles the others.

[I can't reach the Sun-4's now.  I'll update them later.]

5/4/91:

-A -A now warns about using function designators in conditionals
(eg, f(){int g();if(g);})

Null characters in string and character literals are now accepted.

Returning the address of a parameter or a local is now an error.

The compiler proper no longer ignores \<newline> in string and
character literals; `line splicing' must be done by preprocessors.

Erroneously complained about some valid uses of function types,
(eg, int f(int (int));)

Using -b to append data to a prof.out compressed by bprint -c corrupted
the execution counts.

Erroneously complained about a typedef name used as a label at the
first token in a compound statement (eg, typedef int T; f(){T:;})

Erroneously permitted array fields of structs returned by functions to
be passed as arguments (eg, struct foo {char s[63];} g(); f(g().s);)

Subsequent definition of unknown enums caused an assertion failure,
(eg, enum foo x; enum foo {a,b,c};)

Failed to diagnose empty extern/static declarations of enums or
structs (eg, extern enum foo {a};)

Failed to ignore leading white space that spanned input buffers.

Failed to promote case labels to the promoted type of the switch
expression (eg, case (char)16.2:).

In structs/unions without named bit fields, padding specified by
unnamed bit fields was erroneously omitted in initializations. (eg,
struct { char a; int:0; char b; } x = {'a','b'} misinitialized x.b.)

Erroneously complained about extern declarations of sizeless arrays
with block scope that referred to statics with file scope (eg, static
int a[3]; f() { extern int a[]; ...})

On the MIPS, better code for conversions from char/short to unsigned.

On the MIPS, failed to detect overflow in (1<<31)[*/](-1) and crashed.

On the SPARC, taking the address of an argument in leaf functions
caused junk to be stored in the actual argument, eg, f(x){int *p = &x;}

On the SPARC, stdlib.h erroneously defined toupper() and tolower() as
macros; they're library functions.

On the SPARC, RAND_MAX in stdlib.h was erroneously defined as 32767; it
should be 2^31-1.

On Suns, -target sun[34] is now recognized (and ignored).

8/2/91:

Now permits -o to name the output file for -c and -S when
invoked with exactly one source file.

-t now prints char*'s as a address in hex and as a string.

Constants cast to const/volatile were not treated as constant operands
(eg, (const int)23 + 80 was not accepted as a constant expression).

Some generated labels were not of the form Ln, which clogged symbol
tables and confused profilers on some targets.

The declaration `struct S;' failed to introduce a new type when a
struct S was defined in an enclosing scope.

When built with a compiler where `char' is unsigned, lcc failed to
sign-extend `signed char' in constant expressions (eg, (signed char)-4
became 252 instead of -4.)

In structs/unions with bit fields, intra-word padding specified by
unnamed bit fields was erroneously omitted in initializations (eg,
struct {int :8;int a:3;}x={1} initialized x.a to 0 instead of 1).

Crashed when case labels were given outside of switches.

Sometimes computed incorrect values for relationals over two floating
point constants.

Erroneously permitted old-style parameter lists in function
delarators.  Some caused the compiler to crash, eg,
int(*f)(a);g(){(*f)(0);}

On the 68020, SPARC and VAX, -g emitted bad symbol table data for
typedefs of const/volatile types.

On the 68020, lcc suffered an assertion failure occasionally when it
ran out of floating point registers.

On the MIPS, now places constants in the read-only data segment instead
of the text segment.

On the SPARC, now recognizes as leaves functions that return floats or
doubles but use no other floating-point registers, eg, float f(float
x){return x;}

On the SPARC, emitted bad code for leaf functions that took the address
of a float/double argument.

8/13/91:

Generated bad code for expressions with multiple references to fields
of structs returned by functions (eg, f().a + g().b).

Erroneously diagnosed as errors valid function definitions in which
old-style parameters appeared in a declarator nested in parens (eg, int
(*f(a,b))() int a,b; {}).

9/30/91:

"struct S;" is now never an error, even if repeated.

Fixed assertion failure when a comparison was used as a value in an
expression that had a type error, like char*f(){int x;x=(x==1|f());}

-b profiled "while (e) S" wrong when e is constant and under -g.

-P failed to include "const" and "volatile" in its output declarations.

On the 68020, the driver now supplies -Dmc68000O in addition to
-Dmc68000.

On the MIPS, -Wf-Gn specifies the maximum size for data placed in the
"short data" segment ala cc(1); the default is 8, and 0 causes all data
to be placed in the "data" segment. -Wa-Gn and -Wl-Gn pass similar
flags to the assembler and linker, resp.

On the SPARC, structures are now passed using Sun's conventions.
Discard old .o files.

If bprint sees that it's about to print a count INSIDE a number or
identifier, it moves the count to just BEFORE the token.  This
heuristic applies only when macros or comments have confused bprint
about the source code.  (Thanks to Doug.)

10/7/91:

On the SPARC, generated bad code for functions that are declared to
return a struct but then fail to, like struct node f(){}.

-P failed to include "const" and "volatile" in its output declarations.

1/4/92:

lcc formerly stopped compiling after 20 errors; -Wf-e<n> now sets the
error limit to <n>.

The driver now checks for non-existent or unreadable .c or .i files and
does not try to compile them.

Crashed when an unknown typedef declared parameters in old-style
function definitions, like "f(x) T x; {...}".

Crashed when both -b and -n were specified.

Failed to fold case labels that exceeded the limits of the type of the
associated switch expression, like "int i; switch (i) {case0xeb010000:;}".
This yielded bad duplicate case label diagnostics or incorrect code.

Failed to recognize unsigned comparisons with zero as constant expressions.
For example, "int i=5U>=0;" is now accepted.

Failed to diagnose structure initializations with excess initializers,
like "struct { int a,b; } x = { 1,2,3 };".

Failed to count as references occurrences of identifiers in asm, so
locals with no other references were erroneously deleted.

Failed to make each parameter visible at the end of its declarator,
which led to erroneous diagnostics for valid prototypes.  For example,
"f(int a, int b[sizeof a])" is now accepted.

errno.h defined more error codes than are specified by the standard; it
now defines only EDOM and ERANGE.

assert.h, errno.h, locale.h, stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, and time.h
included other headers and thus defined symbols beyond those permitted
by the standard.  They now define only the specified symbols, except for
assert.h, which defines write, sprintf, and abort on some targets.

On the MIPS and SPARC, better code for structure assignment and
structure arguments.

On the SPARC with -g, gdb and dbx printed incorrect values for parameters
that were changed because of extraneous symbol table entries.

On the MIPS with -g, gdb and dbx mislocated some source files when
#include directions contained function and variable definitions.

2/11/92:

Erroneously identified T* as the offending type when sizeof(T) is
unknown or 0 (eg, "void *a,*b;a-b;").  Now correctly fingers T
instead.

Erroneously allowed arithmetic on `void *const' pointers (eg,
"void *const p; int i; p+i;").

Crashed when comparing prototypes with an argument that is a pointer to
a function with a prototype, like
int (*g)(char *,...); void f(int (*)(char *,...)) {} ... f(g);

On Suns and BSD VAXes, ctype.h defined static functions _tolower and
_toupper, which prompted `unreferenced' warnings if they weren't used.

4/13/92:

Crashed when comparing prototypes that differ in only top-level
qualifiers (eg, int f(int); int f(const int);)

The driver no longer ignores extra characters after flags.  As always,
unrecognized flags are sent to the linker; eg, -cg was formerly treated
like -c, but it's now sent to ld, which will complain.

Now recognizes the identity u/1U == u for unsigned u.

-A -A now correctly complains about switch statements with more than
257 cases instead of 127.

On the SPARC, generated incorrect code for calls with a floating-point
argument followed anywhere by an argument involving an integer or
unsigned division, multiplication, or modulus (eg, int i,j; f() {
f(1.0,i/j); })

On the SPARC, generated invalid assembly code for assignments of
structures over 4095 bytes.

12/16/92:

changes/improvements:
with -d0, warns about switch statements with huge jump tables, eg,
switch (i) { case INT_MAX: ...; case INT_MIN: ... }

now accepts identifiers up to 4096 characters long, although the ANSI
standard requires that only the first 31 be examined.

returning a pointer to a local variable now elicits a warning
instead of an error.

now warns about eliding references to incomplete types, eg,
void *x; *x;

with -A -A, now warns when declaring arrays incomplete types,
eg, extern struct s x[];

offsetof is less machine-specific but equivalent to the old one.

On the MIPS, uses fewer of the assembler's pseudo-ops.  The assembly
code looks longer, but it should generate about the same machine code.

On the MIPS, a few stack frames may be larger, to enforce stricter
alignment for the R4000.

errors fixed:
with -n, failed to recognize expressions that dereferenced constant
pointers as valid constant expressions, eg,
struct foo { int a, b; };
unsigned off = (char *)&((struct foo *)0)->b - (char *)0;

generated bad code for some inputs for which the compiler needed
numerous temporaries.

failed to accept function definitions with multiple top-level
prototypes, eg, int (*g(int c))(char) { c = 0; }

failed to warn about overflow in enumeration values, eg,
enum { X = ~0U };

ignored trailing characters of long file names in some "#" lines, which
caused erroneous diagnostics. now accepts names upto 512 characters, and
warns about longer ones.

erroneously made enumerations visible before their optional values, eg,
enum{A=2}; f() { enum {A=A} i = A; } assigned 0 to i instead of 2.

exited with a code of 0 instead of 1 when there was exactly one
"found X expecting Y" diagnostic.

failed to detect overflow in hex character constants, eg, '\x100000000'.

failed to accept assignment of 0U to pointers.

failed to associate tags defined in a parameter list with defining
declarations inside a function, eg,
f(struct S *s) { struct S { int a; }; s->a = 1; }

failed to reject function definitions with storage class typedef.

failed to accept a trailing `,' in initializers for scalars
and unions, eg, int x = {1,};

erroneously defined wchar_t as `char' instead of `unsigned char';
L'\xff' must have the integer value 0xff.

failed to reject type `array of void'.

failed to reject comparing a pointer to an object type
with a pointer to an incomplete type, eg,
extern int (*a)[],(*b)[10]; ...; if (a == b) ...

failed to warn about comparing a function pointer with a void*,
eg, int (*fp)(); ... if (fp == (void *)0) ...

failed to reject (..., 0) as a null pointer constant.

failed to accept redeclaration of functions with differently
qualified parameters, eg, f(int); f(const int);

on the SPARC, under -b, exit() failed to close all open files.

on the MIPS, generated bad code for calls to variadic functions
with a leading floating point arg (eg, f(double x,...)) when
the 2nd actual argument was a float or a double.

12/17/92:

fix bug introduced yesterday into stddef.h's offsetof macro.

12/18/92:

On the MIPS, fixes code generated since 12/16 that crashes most
procedures with >32kb of locals.

2/18/93:

On the MIPS, silently generated incorrect code for some programs that
mix (single-precision) float register variables with int conditional
exprs or int register variables with float conditional exprs.

6/7/93:

There's a new lcc, v2.0

all enums are now ints; old .o files that use enums are incompatible
with new ones.

asm("...") is gone.

diagnostics issued for non-constant case expressions now show the
correct line number.

non-empty declarations that fail to declare at least a declarator, a
tag, or enumeration identifers now draw an error instead of a warning.

failed to recognize `preprocessing numbers' as a superset of integer
and floating constants. doing so can elicit unexpected errors, eg,
i = 0xBE-0xAA; is illegal; the rhs is one preprocessing number that is
not a legal integer constant.

erroneously made old-style parameters visible before they were
declared, and crashed when an old-style parameter hid a global name, eg,
enum {n=10}; f(n,a) int a[n]; int n; {}

crashed when pointers were erroneously compared with non-pointers, eg,
int *p; double f; if (p == f);

crashed with an assertion failure when a non-function was erroneously
used in a call, eg, int x; x();

crashed when extraneous arguments were passed to a function with no
arguments, eg, int f(void); f(1,2);

failed to permit == and != comparisons of incomplete and complete
types, eg, int (*a)[], (*b)[120]; if (a == b) ...

failed to diagnose relational comparisons between pointers to
functions, eg, void (*f)(), (*g)(); ... if (f < g) ...

failed to diagnose illegal uses of "auto" in top-level declarations.

failed to warn about declarations that specify only untagged structs
or unions, eg, struct { int a; };

failed to diagnose incompatible function types from old-style definitions
and new-style declarations, eg, int f(){...} ... int (*p)(int) = f;

erroneously treated the constant -0.0 as 0.0, which IEEE forbids.

erroneously diagnosed tentative unsized array definitions, eg,
a lone "int x[]" is now treated as "int x[]={0}"

failed to recognize integer and floating constants that were longer
than 32 characters and were split across input buffers.

incorrect definitions for va_start, which returned char* instead of
void, and for va_end, which as empty instead of a void expression.

on the VAX under V10, crashed when folding floating-point expressions
that overflowed in contexts that require constants.

on the MIPS, generated invalid assembly code for float arguments passed
in registers 5 or 7 and either declared "register" or assigned to a
register by lcc.

on the SPARC, generated bad code for f(x,g()) where x is a double and g
returns an int or pointer.

7/10/93:

On the MIPS, generated incorrect code for calls in which the first two
args are float or double and the second includes a side-effect (eg,
f(1.0, d+=2.0)).

On the MIPS, avoids a bug in the new MIPS assembler that silently
generates incorrect initializers for some strings and char arrays.

10/29/93:

There's a new lcc on cetus, hydra, and pyxis.  Bugs fixed include:

With -A, failed to warn about old-style function definitions without an
in-scope prototype.

Failed to diagnose tentative definitions of objects with incomplete
types and internal linkages as errors, eg, static in x[];

Erroneously diagnosed as an error comparing a function pointer to a
null pointer constant, eg, int (*f)(); ... if (f == (void *)0) ...

Erroneously diagnosed as errors assignments of enum bit fields to ints.

Erroneously diagnosed as errors non-constant initializations of locals
be enclosed in braces, eg, g() { int i = { f() } }

Erroneously treated enum identifiers declared in an old-style parameter
declaration as parameters, eg, in f(x) enum color { blue } x; {},
"blue" was diagnosed as a missing parameter.

On the MIPS, calls to f(float x, double y) passed y incorrectly.

Plus many theoretically invisible changes.

11/19/93:

On the MIPS, initialized arrays were going into the "short data" segment
and exhausting it too fast.  They're now back in the "long data" segment
where they belong.

On the MIPS, generated an assembler diagnostic and then incorrect code
for struct copies when the size%4 was 2 or 3.

(Announced to only those who reported the errors.  Neither error was silent,
so no one else should have been bitten.)

2/3/94:

lcc now works on slocum.  It generates code that needs static linking,
which SGI now deprecates.  SGI's profiling library uses only dynamic
linking, so avoid -p for now; -b is an alternative of sorts.

next:

On the MIPS, silently generated incorrect code for
main(){struct {...}*f(),x; x=*f();}
